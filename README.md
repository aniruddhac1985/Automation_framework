# BDD Cucumber Framework with Page Object Model

This repository contains an automation test framework built using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It is designed to create readable, maintainable, and scalable automated tests.

## About

The framework leverages Cucumber for writing human-readable test scenarios in Gherkin syntax and uses the Page Object Model to separate page interactions from test logic. This approach ensures easy maintenance and reusability of code.

It supports:
- BDD scenarios using `.feature` files
- Step definitions managing test steps implemented in Java
- Page classes encapsulating UI interactions
- Data-driven testing capabilities using Examples and DataTables

## Technologies

- Java
- Cucumber BDD
- Selenium WebDriver (or specify if different)
- Maven (or Gradle)
- TestNG / JUnit (specify your test runner)
- Page Object Model design pattern
